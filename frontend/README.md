# SmithList
Cookbook and Grocery List App

Description

    This project was built at the request of a friend. His partner would often struggle to organize their family meals for the week, and then putting together a shopping list of the items they would need. The site came very close to what they were looking for, but some limitations of the API hurt the overall user experience.

Language Choices

    I chose React for this project because I was comfortable with the language, while still having a lot to learn about it. The project went much faster than previous ones because of that experience, and I was able to strengthen my skills with React.

Future of this Project

    The SmithList App is probably a finished project for me. Any updates are reliant on me finding a recipe API that better suits my needs. The Tasty API used was good, and the price was right, but way recipe ingredients were stored made it incredibly difficult and time-consuming for me to compile them together across multiple recipes.

    That limitation was a good experience though, because it lead me to sit down and really explore what the user experience could look like with that limitation. I'm ultimately happy with the end result, even though it's not exactly what I set out to achieve.

Reflections

    What surprised me the most about this project, was how quickly I was able to build it compared to previous, similar-sized projects. It showed a growth that had previously gone unnoticed, and definitely inspired confidence.
